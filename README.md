# Pokemon game 
***Authors:** Eden Shkuri & Yosef Schwartz* 

In this project we implemented a Pokemon game which contains agents and Pokemons, and the purpose of the game is that the agens
will collect the highest score by eating Pokemon when each has a different value.
The game was based by a directed weighted graph with graph's algorithms.

#### The game based of 2 parts -
api - contains all the graph classes, e.g. edge data, node data, directed weighted graph, graph algorithms and so. 
This section is responsible of creating graphs, edges and algorithms from graph theory such as shortest path and check whether the graph is connected by using Dijkstra-algorithm anf BFS.  
gameClient - contains all the game planning and running, Pokemon and agent classes, GUI and more.  
This part is responsible for running the game (automatically by algorithm) and the GUI.  
To run the game there is two options, by a jar file or by login with a login screen.

#### Tests:  
There are 2 JUNIT test (using JUNIT 5 version) :  
DWGraph_DSTest and DWGraph_AlgoTest.  

#### An example for one level from the game:
